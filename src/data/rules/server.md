# Team SMP Server Rules

## 1. General Conduct

You are expected to behave respectfully and responsibly while playing on the Team SMP server. By joining, you agree to follow these rules. Failure to do so may result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent bans at the discretion of server staff.

## 2. Communication

### 2.1 No Spamming or Swearing

Excessive messaging, flooding chat, or using offensive language is strictly prohibited. Keep chat clean and respectful.

### 2.2 No Harassment, Hate Speech, or Toxic Behavior

Any form of harassment, discrimination, or toxic behavior towards players or staff will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, racism, sexism, homophobia, and targeted harassment.

## 3. Gameplay Integrity

### 3.1 Duplication and Glitch Exploits

The use of duplication glitches, exploits, or unintended game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage is strictly forbidden. Players found abusing glitches will be subject to punishment, including item rollbacks and bans.

### 3.2 Mods, Hacks, and Unfair Advantages

Any modifications, resource packs, or external software that provide an unfair advantage (e.g., x-ray, auto-clickers, hacked clients) are strictly prohibited. Allowed modifications include aesthetic shaders, minimaps, and performance optimizations such as Sodium or OptiFine. Some modifications, such as automatic tool selectors or elytra swappers, are also allowed, but must be used at the player's own risk.

## 4. Builds and Server Performance

### 4.1 No Offensive Builds

Any structures or pixel art that contain offensive, inappropriate, or controversial content are not allowed. This includes but is not limited to depictions of hate symbols, offensive words, or NSFW content.

### 4.2 No Lag Machines or Server-Disruptive Builds

Intentional construction of lag-inducing contraptions, excessive redstone loops, or any build that negatively impacts server performance is prohibited. Staff may intervene and remove such builds without warning.

## 5. Player Responsibility

### 5.1 Use Common Sense

Players are expected to exercise good judgment and follow the spirit of the rules. Attempting to exploit loopholes or act in a way that is disruptive to the community, even if not explicitly outlined, may result in action taken by staff.

## 6. Enforcement and Appeals

The Team SMP staff reserves the right to enforce these rules at their discretion. If you believe you were unfairly punished, you may submit an appeal via the designated channels.

## 7. Amendments

These rules are subject to change at any time. Continued use of the server constitutes acceptance of the most up-to-date version of the rules.
