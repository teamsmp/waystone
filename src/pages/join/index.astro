<Layout title="Join â€¢ Team SMP">
  <p class="text-xl font-light mb-4 lg:w-2/3">
    Join the Team SMP using these simple instructions!
  </p>

  <h1 class={cn(tHead())}>Java Edition</h1>
  <p class="mb-1 lg:w-2/3">
    On Java Edition, enter the multiplayer and click 'add server'. Next, paste
    in the server IP:
  </p>
  <div class="bg-zinc-700 w-fit py-2 px-4 ms-2 text-lg mb-1 select-all font-mono">
    mc.teamsmp.uk
  </div>
  <p class="mb-2 lg:w-2/3">
    The name of the server is optional, but you can type in something like 'Team
    SMP' to make it easier to find among other servers. Click 'done' and you can
    join the server by double-clicking on it in the menu.
  </p>

  <h1 class={cn(tHead())}>Bedrock Edition (Mobile/PC)</h1>
  <p class="mb-1 lg:w-2/3">
    In order to join the Team SMP on Bedrock Edition, press 'play' and go to the
    'servers' tab. On the left, scroll down until you see a button that says
    'add server'. Click this button and paste the Bedrock IP into the 'server
    address' box:
  </p>
  <div class="bg-zinc-700 w-fit py-2 px-4 ms-2 text-lg mb-1 select-all font-mono">
    be.teamsmp.uk
  </div>
  <p class="mb-2 lg:w-2/3">
    Leave the port as default (19132) and press 'save'. Next, simply click on
    the server on the list and press 'join server'. That should be it.
  </p>

  <h1 class={cn(tHead())}>Bedrock Edition (Console)</h1>
  <p class="mb-2 lg:w-2/3">
    On Bedrock for consoles, you are not able to add custom servers, so you must
    use a different method. Go to your friends menu <b
      >in Minecraft, not your console's built-in one</b
    >, and add JunglTemple as a friend. When joining the friend, you should be
    taken to the Team SMP.
  </p>
