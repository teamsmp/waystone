  <p class="text-xl font-light mb-4 lg:w-2/3">
    The Team SMP is a survival Minecraft server run by XxDreamXxXx and
    JunglTemple.
  </p>

  <h2 class={cn(tHead())}>Economy</h2>
  <p class="mb-2 lg:w-2/3">
    <b>Trade with Other Players Using Cubits.</b>
    Cubits are the official currency of the Team SMP, allowing players to buy, sell,
    and trade items within the server. Earn Cubits through various activities, like
    mining or completing tasks, and use them to purchase resources, trade with others,
    or contribute to your town's growth. Whether you're a skilled builder or a savvy
    trader, Cubits are key to thriving in our dynamic economy.
  </p>

  <h2 class={cn(tHead())}>Teams</h2>
  <p class="mb-2 lg:w-2/3">
    <b>Join a Team and Build Together.</b>
    Form or join a team on the Team SMP to collaborate with others, share resources,
    and tackle challenges together. Teams allow players to work on massive builds,
    defend their towns, and compete in server-wide events. Whether you're focused
    on construction, exploration, or PvP, teaming up gives you a greater chance to
    succeed and make your mark on the server.
  </p>

  <h2 class={cn(tHead())}>Minigames</h2>
  <p class="mb-2 lg:w-2/3">
    <b>For when you don't want to play Survival.</b> Although it's not the main focus,
    there are minigames like TNTRun and BedWars available on the Team SMP. When Survival
    is restarting, or you're just bored, check Minigames out.
